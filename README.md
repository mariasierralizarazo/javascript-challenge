Data analysis using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js
<hr></hr>
<p align="justify">
Even though doing a good data analysis is very important, the way how data is presented also has a very significant value. 
In this project, the main goal was to append complete and filter given data to the given website. <br/>
In 
<a href="https://github.com/mariasierralizarazo/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-1"> UFO-level-1 </a>, the user would be able to see all the information
in the table as soon as he/she opens the website; however, the website will also allow filter the table per date. If the entered date is not registered in the data, 
then the user will receive a message indicating there are no results for that search.

</br>
In <a href="https://github.com/mariasierralizarazo/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-2"> UFO-level-2 </a>, the user will see the same data, but the difference is that he/she will be able to filter per category and then per parameter.
The available categories are Date/Time, State, City, Country, and Shape.  Once the user selects the category from the dropdown menu, 
he/she will be able to type a word or parameter he/she would like to search.

<strong> Used tools: </strong> </br>
- D3 - Javascript: Used for selecting spaces and ID from the HTML page that would be manipulated or modified. </br>
- Listening to events with Javascript: to register and act according to any change in the website.
In this case, events are used when the user clicks on the Filter Data bottom, and the website shows the filtered data or the no results announcement. </br> 
- HTML and bootstrap and .css for creating the website (this website was given and modified for the exercise, but no an original creation) </br>
